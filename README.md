# ATM Project

This is my ATM program. I made it to learn Python.

## What it does

- Users can check balance, withdraw money, deposit money, change PIN
- Admins can create users, delete users, see transactions, set cash
- PINs are hashed
- Data saved in db.json file

## How to run

```bash
python atm.py
